    It is important to understand that this is not the only way to solve this
  assignment, merely the way that worked best for me.
  ############################################################################

  What is Lariat? Under the hood, Lariat looks like a "linked list of arrays".

    The main goal is to have a more efficient (compared to array) insert in the
  middle. Reminder: if array (and consequently std::vector) insert an element 
  in the middle, all elements to the right of the insert position have to be
  shifted 1 position to the right to free a spot for new element. This is O(N)
  (linear) operation. Another possible problem is if there is not enough space,
  which will required reallocation if the whole array.
    Lariat solves the problem by storing small segments of contiguous memory 
  non-contiguously. 
    During insert one of 2 things can happen (see detail later):
    - the contiguous block may have extra space, so only some elements have to
      be shifted:
//    0  1            2  3  4        // index
// +------------+  +------------+  
// |  1  3     -|->|  4  5  6  -|->  // data
// +------------+  +------------+  
// after insert 2 before 3
//    0  1  2         3  4  5         6  7  8       
// +------------+  +------------+  +------------+  
// |  1  2  3  -|->|  4  5  6  -|->|  9  9  9  -|->
// +------------+  +------------+  +------------+  
// only value 3 had to shifted

    - block containing insert position is full, then we split it:
// insert 8 before 5
// first split:
//    0  1  2         3  4            5  6            6  7  8       
// +------------+  +------------+  +------------+  +------------+  
// |  1  2  3  -|->|  4  8     -|->|  5  6     -|->|  9  9  9  -|->
// +------------+  +------------+  +------------+  +------------+  
// now insert
//    0  1  2         3  4            5  6            7  8  9       
// +------------+  +------------+  +------------+  +------------+    
// |  1  2  3  -|->|  4  8     -|->|  5  6     -|->|  9  9  9  -|->
// +------------+  +------------+  +------------+  +------------+    
// only values 5 and 6 were copied

            ]]]>>>> LUKE'S GUIDE TO TEMPLATED TEMPLATES <<<<[[[
            ----------------------  OR  -----------------------
             Nesting Function Templates within Class Templates

  "We put some templates in your templates, so you could generate code at compile
  time while you generate code at compile time."
      -C++

  A template is a section of code like any other that gets "written" at compile
  time, rather than when you actually write templated code. In this sense,
  writing a template is about using the compiler to your own advantage to avoid
  doing unnecessary work.

       -= Laziness FTW =-

  A normal function template is declared as such:

    template<typename T>
    void Foo(T bar);

  The definition requires knowledge of the template parameters in order to work:

    template<typename T>
    void Foo<T>(T bar) {
      //     |
      //      `-[function template ]

      //...
    }

    In the Lariat assignment, you will have to make a templated copy constructor
  and assignment operator for the Lariat template class. This is similar to
  writing a static function template, but it's written within another
  encompassing template, the Lariat class in this case.

    The basic declaration of the function is just like a normal template
  function, but within a class scope.

    template<typename T>
    class Foo
    {
      //...

      template<typename Bar>
      void Baz(Bar & qux);

      //...
    };

    The definition of the function takes a little bit more work, which may be
  confusing at first.

    template<typename T>    // Gives the external class template information
    template<typename Bar>  // Gives the internal function template information
    void Foo<T>::Baz<Bar>(Bar & qux)
    { // |          |
      // |           `-[function signature]
      //  `-[class namespace]

      // ...
    }

  The first template declaration belongs to the class, which may be instantiated
  multiple times with multiple name-mangled signatures based on the compiler's
  implementation of templates.

  The second template declaration belongs to the function, which will likely be
  instantiated multiple times for every single class instantiation. In this way
  the structure resembles a tree:

                      +-source------------------------------+
                      | original code written by programmer |
                      +-------------------------------------+
                         /                               \
             +-class---------+                     +-class---------+
             | instantiation |                     | instantiation |
             | for type A    |                     | for type B    |
             +---------------+                     +---------------+
             /               \                     /               \
  +-function------+ +-function------+      +-function------+ +-function------+
  | type A        | | type B        |      | type A        | | type B        |
  | instantiation | | instantiation |      | instantiation | | instantiation |
  +---------------+ +---------------+      +---------------+ +---------------+

                                      #dat_ascii

    The next little template trick you might run into with this assignment comes
  when you try to refer to internal member types in the instantiation of code.
  I personally used this in my helper functions that returned pointers to nodes
  in the list, but it's useful for any further template work you might be
  interested in doing.

    Dependent types are also instantiated for each class, with the exact same
  process as function templates. This means that using just the internal name
  in external code will lead to type confusion, where the compiler isn't sure
  which owning class is being referred to.

    A class class template with a member type and a member function returning a
  pointer to the member type:

    template<typename T>
    class Foo
    {
      //...

      struct Bar
      {
        //...
      }

      Bar * Baz();

      //...
    };

    The member function here must be defined as such:

    template<typename T>
    typename Foo<T>::Bar * Foo<T>::Baz()
    { // |       |    |       |     |
      // |       |    |       |      `-[function signature]
      // |       |    |        `-[class namespace]
      // |       |     `-[member typename]
      // |        `-[class namespace]
      //  `-[declaration of token as user-defined type]

      //...
    }

    The last real trick I want to share with you pertains directly to the copy
  constructors this assignment requires. At their instantiation, class templates
  only have direct access to their own instantiation's member variable. This
  means that in order to see another instantiation's private variables, there
  must be a declaration of each instantiation as a friend.

    How do you make something to account for any scenario at compile time?

    Simple. More templates.

    Declare a friend class template in your original class template.

    template<typename T>>
    class Foo
    {
      //...

      template<typename U>  //[nested template declaration]
      friend class Foo<U>;  //[friend declaration for class template]

      //...
    }

    This has been my brief introduction to templates as they pertain to this
  assignment. They may seem scary, but templates allow for a greater depth and
  elegance of code, decreasing the total writing time and reducing the volume of
  duplicated code.

  =============================Template Parameters============================
    The Lariat class has two template parameters which are generally self-explanatory.

  typename T: The type of data being stored in the data structure
  int Size: The logical size of the arrays within each node

  ==============================Member Variables==============================
    The Lariat class provided by Volper has five member variables.

  head_: A pointer to the first node in the linked list
  tail_: A pointer to the last node in the linked list
  size_: An integer for the total number of elements actively storing data
  nodecount_: An integer for the number of nodes in the linked list
  asize_: An integer for the size of the array within each node
          Interchangeable with the template parameter <Size>

  =================================Member Type================================
    The Lariat class has one member type, the LNode struct used in the linked
  list internal implementation. LNode has four member variables of its own.

  next: A pointer to the next node in the linked list
  prev: A pointer to the previous node in the linked list
  count: An integer to track of how many elements the LNode is actively storing
  values: An array of <Size> elements of type <T>

    Remember to check for null at any point you're dealing with pointers. In
  particular, make sure to check if the head and tail are null before you try
  to work with them. I find that not dereferencing null is generally the better
  programming practice.
    Also remember to update the size_ and nodecount_ member variables where
  necessary.

/*******************************************************************************
========================= Constructors and Destructor ==========================
*******************************************************************************/

// Constructor
  // This constructor is really simple. You don't need to do any logic, just
    // use a member initializer list to initialize

// Copy Constructor (own-type)
  // This is the standard copy constructor. The function should loop through the
    // instance passed in, pushing each element of the other onto the back of
    // the one being constructed.
  // It should be done using the algorithm for (or directly calling) push_back
    // so that all the nodes are split correctly.

// Copy Constructor (template)
  // This copy constructor is algorithmically identical to the own-type
    // constructor, but is templated to allow for a Lariat type instantiation
    // with different parameters for <T> and <Size>.
  // Refer to the above guide to templates for details on how to write the
    // function signature.

// Destructor
  // The destructor is a simple, generic destructor. It's sole purpose is to
    // free all the nodes in the linked list so there are no memory leaks.

/*******************************************************************************
============================ Assignment Operators ==============================
*******************************************************************************/

// operator= (own-type)
  // This assignment operator generally works exactly the same as you might
    // expect. Set the non-pointer members as necessary, clear this instance's
    // data, then walk through the right-hand argument's list adding each
    // element to this instance

// operator= (template)
  // This assignment operator follows the exact same algorithm as the own-type
    // version, but is a nested template like I described above.

/*******************************************************************************
============================== Element Addition ================================
*******************************************************************************/

// insert
// Insert an element into the data structure at the index, between the element
// at [index - 1] and the element at [index]
// The first thing to this function is to check for an Out of Bounds error. If
// the index is invalid, throw a LariatException with E_BAD_INDEX and the
// description "Subscript is out of range"
// Make sure to handle the "edge" cases, which allow for insertion at the end
// of the deque as well as the beginning. I personally suggest calling
// push_back and push_front in these cases, as it helps minimize the amount
//  of code written and the algorithm is identical anyways.
// The next thing to do is to set up the actual insertion algorithm.
// First, find the node and local index of the element being inserted. This
// can be done with the findElement helper function detailed in the
// Recommended Helper Functions section of this guide.
// Next, shift all elements past that local index one element to the right.
// This can be done with the shiftUp function detailed in the Recommended
// Helper Functions section of the guide.

// Next, you will need to split the node.
// I would recommend writing a helper function for this algorithm as it
// will be used elsewhere. I have detailed the split algorithm in the
// Recommended Helper Functions section below.
// You will need to transfer the overflow to the last element of the new
// node created by the split. It is possible to put this part of the
// algorithm directly in the split function. I will not detail that in
// this guide, but rather leave it for you to discover on your own.
// Working out that algorithm will probably make your code much cleaner,
// so I would definitely recommend figuring it out.
// As the split algorithm accurately updates the node counts for the split
// nodes, the only thing left to do is increment the node count.

// push_back
// This is an easy algorithm using the split function.
// If the tail node is full, split the node and update the tail_ pointer.
// Set the last element in the tail's array to the value.
// Increment the tail node's count.

// push_front
// This algorithm is more similar to the insert function than the push_back
// algorithm, but is still relatively simple.
// If the head node is empty, increment the node's count.
// If the head node is full, you will need to shift the elements up, in the
// same way they were shifted in the insert function, making sure to track
// the overflow.
// Next you will need to split the node.
// In order to account for splitting the only node in the linked list, you
// will have to update the tail_ pointer as necessary.
// If the head node isn't full yet, just shift the head node up an element
// from element 0 and increase the count.
// Set the 0'th element of the head to the value.

/*******************************************************************************
=============================== Element Removal ================================
*******************************************************************************/

// erase
// This function uses the findElement helper function I have detailed in the
// Recommended Helper Functions section of this guide. Having implemented
// that, the function itself is relatively simple.
// You can use the pop_back and pop_front functions if the index requested is
// the first or last element.
// First, find the containing node and local index of the requested global
// index.
// Shift all the elements in the node beyond the local index left one element,
// covering the element being erased. This is done with the shiftDown
// function detailed in the Recommended Helper Functions section. Make sure
// to account for the node being only one element large.
// Decrement the node's count.

// pop_back
// Decrement the count of the tail node.

// pop_front
// Shift all elements in the head node down one element.
// Decrement the head's count.
// If the head node is now empty, free the associated memory.

/*******************************************************************************
================================ Element Access ================================
*******************************************************************************/
// As the const and non-const versions of these functions are algorithmically
// and syntactically identical, I would recommend (may Shilling forgive me)
// copy/pasting the code from one to the other. You can't call one from inside
// the other, as that would violate the const requirements.

// operator[]
// Find the containing node and local index of the index passed in. Like
// insert and erase, this is easily done with the findElement helper
// function I detailed in the Recommended Helper Functions section of this
// guide.
// Return the element at the local index of the containing node.

// first
// This is one of the easiest functions in this assignment.
// Return the first element of the head node.

// last
// This is also an easy function.
// Return the last element in the tail node.

/*******************************************************************************
========================== Data Structure Information ==========================
*******************************************************************************/

// find
// Walk the list in a similar fashion to that detailed in the findElement
// helper function, but check equivalence for each element in each node,
// returning the index when the desired element is found.
// If the desired element is not found, return the total number of elements
// contained in the data structure.

// size
// You should be tracking the size_ member variable throughout the element
// addition and removal processes. Return that variable now.

/*******************************************************************************
============================ Data Structure Control ============================
*******************************************************************************/

// clear
// This is a relatively simple function with a similar algorithm to the
// class destructor.
// First, loop through the list, freeing each node in turn.
// Once the list is empty, update the necessary member variables.

// compact
// Compact takes all the data stored in the linked list and moves it into the
// smallest number of nodes possible. Then it frees all empty nodes at the
// end of the list.
// The algorithm for this walks the list at two points in parallel. I will
// refer to the walker having elements shifted into it as the left foot and
// the walker reading through the elements to shift as the right foot.
// First, loop through the list with both feet until the left node is not
// already full and the right foot hasn't walked off the list.
// Next, walk through the list while the right foot hasn't lost the list.
// This loop should first store the count of elements in the right node,
// then set the count of the right node to zero. This allows the left foot
// to update it as it is given elements to store.
// This loop should have a nested loop that stores each value from the right
// foot in the left foot's node, and steps the left foot to the next node
// when it is filled.

// First, create a new node to split the original node into.
// Calculate the index from which to move elements over from. This should
// account for an element being appended to the second node after the

// Set the count of the original node to index, and insert the added node
// immediately after the original node.

// findElement
// This function takes a global index to find in the deque and must return
// both a pointer to the node in the list and the local index of the element
// in the returned node.
// Clearly returning multiple variables is a *small* challenge in C and C++,
// so you will have to find a way to work around that.
// The algorithm for this function is focused around looping through the list
// and tracking the total number of elements stored before the current
// node. I used a counter and added each node's count until I passed the
// desired global index.
// Because each node in the list only stores the number of elements it is
// using actively, the count of each has to be added individually to keep an
// accurate count of the number of elements that have been stepped over.

// shiftUp
// This helper function is almost identical to one that was particularly
// useful for the CS170 Vector lab. It uses a simple swap algorithm to swap
// every element between the index and the last element in the node's array
// in place.
// Make sure your bound-checking is good and you have accurately defined the
// limits of your memory. If you find a wrong value somewhere unexpected,
// you probably have the index limit wrong somehow.

          Notice that the third element, the index, now holds the value that
          would have been pushed off the end of the array. This is useful for
          tracking the last element that would have been lost.

// I would highly recommend writing a templatized swap function. It has uses
// in most basic algorithms related to data structures.

// shiftDown
// The shift down helper function works very similarly to the shift up, by
// swapping values in the node's array.
// The key difference between the two is that the shift down function does
// not have a fixed index. It should move down the array, swapping each
// element with the element immediately before it. In this way, it still
// preserves the data it is writing over, but does so by shifting it from
// the start of the range to the end rather than the opposited direction.
