Extend your BSTmap to AVLmap.

API is exactly the same. You just add rebalancing.

Implement:
1) rotations - both left and right
2) balance calculation
3) AVL logic - this step will require modification of the BST insert and erase

You may either copy your BSTmap implementation and add the above functionality
or you may derive AVLmap from BSTmap, the latter is better solution, but there
will be some complications with template inheritance. I strongly suggest
starting with just copying BSTmap implementation, if you have time left try 
inheritance.
