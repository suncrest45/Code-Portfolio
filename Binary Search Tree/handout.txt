Implement BST as discussed in the slides. Instead of storing a single piece of data 
per node we store a pair (key, value) which is viewed as
"map [ key ] = value".

Follow the driver:
implement
1) BST insert
2) BST find and basic non-const iterator features - constructor and comparison to "end"
3) BST delete
4) iterator post and pre increment (successor) and decrement ( predecessor)
5) iterator derefencing
6) BST copy and assignment (should be O(N) - proportional to the number of elements in the tree)
7) BST move copy and assignment (C++11 feature - extra credit), should be constant time.
